    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p> Rivers, in partnership with the local government, is a transformative initiative with a singular, powerful goal: to end homelessness at its root and restore human dignity, guided by compassion and God-given purpose. </p>
    <p> Our mission is not limited to offering temporary shelter; instead, we envision a future where individuals once experiencing homelessness are renewed in spirit, empowered to regain independence, achieve homeownership, and reenter society as fully self-sufficient citizens. We believe in building not just homes, but lives, careers, and futures grounded in hope. </p>
    <p> We see homelessness not just as a lack of shelter, but as a breakdown of support systems, opportunity, and hope. Therefore, our approach is holistic—addressing mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual needs in an environment that reflects care, luxury, and respect. </p>

  <h2 class="layout-header3">The Problem </h2>
  <h3 class="layout-header2">Homeless people are overtaking cities. </h3>
  <p class="layout-paragraph">It is so bad that President Trump is taking controversial, drastic action to take back cities from being overrun by the homeless population.  He is giving them a choice to leave the country or face arrest.</p>
</section>

  <div class="intake-content">
    <h2>The Pain of Homelessness</h2>
    <p>
      In the heart of Miami-Dade County, where bright sunlight dances on turquoise waters and luxury condos pierce the skyline, another world exists in the shadows—one marked by the quiet agony of homelessness. On street corners and beneath highway overpasses, people wander with no clear destination, carrying their entire lives in worn backpacks or plastic bags. Their possessions—if they have any—fit into the palm of a hand. The air is heavy with the scent of exhaust and salt, but for them, it’s also thick with uncertainty. Each day is a relentless search for shade from the scorching heat, a bench to rest on without being asked to leave, or a safe patch of concrete to lay their head when night falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those without shelter, every hour revolves around survival. A drink of clean water, a piece of bread, or a pair of dry socks becomes a victory in a day full of loss. The humid Miami air clings to their skin, making it nearly impossible to stay clean, while sudden rainstorms soak whatever few belongings they own. They wander from place to place, hoping to find a soup kitchen still serving meals or a public restroom where they won’t be chased away. Conversations are often reduced to asking strangers for a dollar or directions to the nearest shelter—both requests met with mixed responses. In a county overflowing with wealth, the struggle for these most basic human needs can feel like an invisible battle fought on an uneven field.

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Rivers is not a typical homeless shelter. It is an architectural and social sanctuary designed with the intention of radically reimagining what transitional housing can be. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The estate will be gated and beautifully landscaped, with a layout reminiscent of The White House-style grounds, suggesting order, dignity, and grandeur. The chosen color palette—royal blue, navy, gold, and platinum—invokes a sense of nobility, creating an environment that uplifts rather than diminishes.

      <div class="purpose-container">
        <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Our primary purpose is to get people off the street and end homelessness. Beyond immediate shelter, we aim to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Heal and restore individuals and reintroduce them back into society.</li>
          <li>Help residents with resume building and obtaining licenses.</li>
          <li>Provide financial services and guidance towards best jobs.</li>
          <li>Offer recreational facilities like a game room and computer room.</li>
          <li>Provide a chapel for spiritual support.</li>
